JSynthLib - A universal MIDI editor and librarian

Description:

        JSynthLib is a universal MIDI editor and librarian. The
        project aims to support as many MIDI enabled devices as
        possible.

Install:

  Step 1: Java Runtime Environment

        Make sure you have the J2SE JRE (Java Runtime Environment) or
        JDK (Java Development Kit) which supports Java 1.6 or
        later. If you do not have it, you can download it from
        http://java.sun.com/. If you plan to develop a Java program (for
        example a JSynthLib driver for your synth), you need the
        JDK. Otherwise you just need the JRE.

  Step 2: MIDI Provider

        JSynthLib uses a MIDI Provider, which is a platform dependent
        layer of the Java MIDI API. Depending on your operating system,
        you may have to install a MIDI Provider.

    Microsoft Windows

        If you have a J2SE version 1.6 or newer installed, you don't
        need to install a MIDI Provider.

    GNU/Linux

        If you have a J2SE version 1.6 or newer installed, you don't
        need to install a MIDI Provider.

    Mac OS X

        At the time of writing (June 2004) you need to install a MIDI
        Provider.

        Download the latest CAProvider.jar from the JSynthLib SourceForge
        site and copy it to the /Library/Java/Extensions/ folder (the
        ~/Library/Java/Extensions/ folder wull also work for a single user
        installation).

        You may use Plum Stone instead of CAProvider.

  Step 3: Installing JSynthLib

        Download the latest JSynthLib-XXX.jar file from the JSynthLib site
        or JSynthLib SourceForge site and copy it to any
        directory (for example C:\Program Files\JSynthLib\ or
        /Applications/JsynthLib/).

        An application bundle may be provided for Mac OS X.

        Invoke JSynthLib.

  Step 4: Invoking JSynthLib

    Microsoft Windows

          Run JSynthLib.jar by typing
                java -jar JSynthLib-XXX.jar
          from a command prompt. You may create a shortcut on the
          desktop to JSynthLib.jar.

    GNU/Linux

          Run JSynthLib.jar by typing
                java -jar JSynthLib-XXX.jar
          from a shell prompt.

    Mac OS X

          Run JSynthLib.jar by typing
                java -Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true -jar JSynthLib-XXX.jar
          from a Terminal. You can alternatively double click the jar file,
          but each window will have it's own menu bar. An application bundle
          would remove the need for this step.

        Go to Window->Preferences and set preferences (such as look
        and feel, default file directories, default MIDI port, etc.)
        as you wish.

        Go to Window->Synths and add and configure the synthesizers
        you want to use with JSynthLib.
