Installation instruction
========================

  Step 1: Java Runtime Environment

        Make sure you have the J2SE JRE (Java Runtime Environment) or
        JDK (Java Development Kit) which supports Java 1.6 or
        later. If you do not have it, you can download it from
        http://java.sun.com/. If you plan to develop a Java program (for
        example a JSynthLib driver for your synth), you need the
        JDK. Otherwise you just need the JRE.

  Step 2: Installing JSynthLib

    Microsoft Windows

          Download JSynthLib-<version>-setup.exe and run the installer

    GNU/Linux

          Download jsynthlib-<version>-executable.jar

    Mac OS X

          Download JSynthLib-<version>.dmg and drag JSynthLib.app to your Applications folder

  Step 3: Invoking JSynthLib

    Microsoft Windows

          Shortcut to JSynthLib has been installed in the start menu

    GNU/Linux

          Run JSynthLib.jar by typing
                java -jar jsynthlib-<version>-executable.jar
          from a shell prompt.

    Mac OS X

          Run the JSynthLib app from the Applications menu
          Make sure the selected MIDI ports are prefixed with 'CoreMidi'
          in the configuration window (see below).

  Step 4: Configuring JSynthLib

        Go to Window->Preferences and set preferences (such as look
        and feel, default file directories, default MIDI port, etc.)
        as you wish.

        Go to Window->Preferences->Synth Drivers to add and configure
        the synthesizers you want to use with JSynthLib.

        Please refer to the in application help for more details.
