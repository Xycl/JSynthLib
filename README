JSynthLib

JSynthLib is a universal MIDI synthesizer librarian / editor. 
The project aims to eventually support all existing synthesizers.

Development setup:

https://sourceforge.net/p/jsynthlib/wiki/Programmer%27s%20Guide/#setup-ide

The fork is focussing on reanimation of the project. Nested dependencies needs to be upgraded.
JavaFX packages must be switched to openJFX packages. Target JDK Runtime should be Java 11+ with
source code compliance to Java 1.8. Resource resolvers needs to be refactored.
